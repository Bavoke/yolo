# Ansible Playbook Explanation

This Ansible playbook uses modular roles to deploy a full-stack e-commerce dashboard.

## Roles

1. **setup-mongodb**: Sets up MongoDB container with persistent volume and custom network.
2. **backend-deployment**: Deploys Node.js backend connected to MongoDB.
3. **frontend-deployment**: Deploys React frontend connected to backend.

Each role defines:
- Variables in `vars/main.yml`
- Tasks in `tasks/main.yml`

## Tags

Each role is tagged:
- `mongodb`, `backend`, `frontend`

This allows selective execution during testing or troubleshooting.

## Execution Flow

1. The playbook runs on a Vagrant-provisioned Ubuntu VM.
2. It pulls images and starts containers in order: MongoDB â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend.
3. All containers run on a shared network to allow communication.
